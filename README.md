# Image_Resolution-SRGAN
SRGAN (Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network) is a deep learning model designed to generate high-resolution images from low-resolution inputs, and I applied it to the DIV2K dataset for training and evaluation.

(Comparison between Original, Bicubic, SRResNet, SRGAN)

General Metrics Compared: 
PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio) – Higher is better. 
SSIM (Structural Similarity Index) – Higher is better. 
MSE (Mean Squared Error) – Lower is better.
